**Poisson Distribution**  

+ Where the *mean* and *variance* of the data are equal (λ).  
+ Lower bound at 0 but no upper bound (discrete).  

Drawback: May not accurately describe the variability of the counts.

**Normal Distribution** - [Article Link](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/differences-between-normal-and-poisson-distributions/#:~:text=One%20difference%20is%20that%20in,t%20quite%20behave%20the%20same.)  

+ No bounds.  
+ Any value from -∞ to ∞ is possible  
+ Mean is not equal to variance.

**Negative Binomial Distribution** -  [Article Link](https://towardsdatascience.com/negative-binomial-regression-f99031bb25b4)   

+ Regression model that does not make the equi-dispersion assumption i.e.not assume that variance = mean.  
+ Variance greater than the mean = over-dispersion, variance less than the mean = under-dispersion.  
+ Extension of a Poisson distribution to account for *overdispersed* data.  
+ For DE anlysis: ANOVA and linear regression are basically the same. However, for transcriptomics data it is better to use the linear models in special software, such as DEseq2, edgeR or limma. In these programs you can use the same linear models as you do now with your ANOVA, but they use statistics better suitable for RNA-seq data.
